# variables (in python we can change the data type of variable if we assign it with integer then we can change it later with the another one)
# no need to put the data type before the varible 

a = 3 #int
b = 3.9 #float
d = "3" #char
print(d)

a = "Shraddha"
print(a)

# None is the data type which means nothing
e = None
print(e)

# Typecasting in python to change one datatype to another
f = "5"
print(int(f) + 1)
